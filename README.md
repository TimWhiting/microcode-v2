## MicroCode (version 2)

MicroCode is an icon-based programming language and editor for young learners to code with the [BBC micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org). MicroCode allows you to program the micro:bit V2 with only an [display shield accessory](https://github.com/microbit-apps/display-shield) - _no other computer is required!_

## Getting started with MicroCode

### With hardware

You will need a micro:bit V2 and one of the [display shields for the microbit](https://github.com/microbit-apps/display-shield).
Download the [microcode hex file](./assets/microcode.hex) and copy it your micro:bit.

### With simulators

You can load this repo into [https://makecode.microbit.org/beta](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta) using the import button on the right-hand side of the home page via "Import URL". Enter [https://github.com/microbit-apps/microcode-v2](https://github.com/microbit-apps/microcode-v2) as the URL.

## What's new?

-   MicroCode is built using [MakeCode for the micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta), which
    provides direct access to all the micro:bit APIs available through MakeCode.

-   Decimal notation (instead of the 1-5 dots in the original MicroCode)

-   Uniform support for sensors

## What happened to MicroCode v1 and its cool features?

We soon will be removing support for [MicroCode v1]
(https://aka.ms/microcode). We will bring back the following features from MicroCode v1:

-   Numbers via 1-5 counting dots (instead of decimal notation)
-   Jacdac services
-   Robot cars
-   Localization

## Development
