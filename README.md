## MicroCode (version 2)

MicroCode is an icon-based programming language and editor for young learners to code with the [BBC micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org). MicroCode allows you to program the micro:bit V2 with only an [display shield accessory](https://makecode.microbit.org/pkg/microbit-apps/display-shield) - _no other computer is required!_

## Getting started with MicroCode

### With hardware

To use MicroCode, you will need to:

1. Get a micro:bit (v2) and one of the [display shields](https://makecode.microbit.org/pkg/microbit-apps/display-shield).
2. Download the [microcode hex file](./assets/microcode-v2.hex) and copy it your micro:bit.
3. Insert the micro:bit into the display shield, and make sure the combination is powered.

With the above hardware, in addition to the freely-available MicroCode software, you can also make use
of these other great programming environments:

-   create your own graphics with [MakeCode for micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org) and the [display shield extension](makecode.microbit.org/pkg/microbit-apps/display-shield))
-   develop retro arcade games wuth [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com)

### With simulators

You can load this repo into [https://makecode.microbit.org/beta](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta) using the import button on the right-hand side of the home page via "Import URL". Enter [https://github.com/microbit-apps/microcode-v2](https://github.com/microbit-apps/microcode-v2) as the URL.

## What's new?

-   MicroCode is built using [MakeCode for the micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta), which
    provides direct access to all the micro:bit APIs available through MakeCode

-   Decimal notation (instead of the 1-5 dots in MicroCode-classic)

-   Math (+, -, \*, /) and comparison (=, !=, <, >) operators

-   Uniform support for sensors

-   Lots of changes to improve reliability

## What happened to MicroCode-classic and its features?

While we soon will retire the [MicroCode-classic](https://aka.ms/microcode) web site, we plan to bring back the following features from MicroCode-classic:

-   Option to use 1-5 dots, instead of decimal notation, for beginners.
-   Jacdac services
-   Robot cars
-   Localization

## Development
